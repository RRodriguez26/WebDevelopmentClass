    <h1>Database Access</h1>
    <h3>Using Java Classes - Outputs JSON</h3>

    <p>
        If you would like to see my <strong>Simple Database Access API</strong> open up in a new tab,
        click <a href="webUser/getAllSimple" target="_blank">here</a>. This API only 
        works locally, does not use many java classes and outputs content type=
        "text/html" which is not very useful. But the code is simple and easy to 
        read. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you would like to see my <strong>Reusable Database Access API</strong> open up in a new tab,
        click <a href="webUser/getAll" target="_blank">here</a>. This code is well 
        designed and easy for the client to consume because it outputs from java objects 
        that have been converted to JSON.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you would like to see my <strong>JSON Class API</strong> open up in a new tab,
        click <a href="jsonClass" target="_blank">here</a>. If the output 
        shows up on one line, remember to download and add the JSON View 
        extension to Chrome.
